# Animaterm

ðŸ“Ÿ Automatically create terminal animations from script

## Usage

Install from the github repo

```sh
npm i -g 'github:iamogbz/animaterm'
```

> You do not need the peer dependencies except you need to render in the `gif` format
>
> The terminalizer (`tlz`) renderer produces better gifs but requires an additional dependency
>
> TODO: support rendering fancy console text colors and formatting

Run the `animaterm` bin with cli options

```sh
animaterm script.json output.svg
```

> Also supports [`.gif`](./docs/usage.gif) as the output format
>
> Set the renderer using the output extension e.g. `output.gif` or `output.tlz`

![demo](./docs/usage.svg)

> This demo animation was created using only `animaterm`

### Script

Samples available in the [end-to-end scripts](./e2e/).

This is a `JSON` file with the following structure:

```ts
Step[]
```

That is a `JSON` array at the root where each `Step` is defined by the following interface:

https://github.com/iamogbz/animaterm/blob/d277aae/src/types.d.ts#L49-L83

#### Descriptions

##### clear

##### copy

Copy from start line and position to end line and position as defined in `payload`

##### enter

Return and run commands typed in previous steps

##### paste

> NOTE: does not paste from system clipboard

##### type

Simulate user typing characters from text in `payload`

##### waitForOutput

https://github.com/iamogbz/animaterm/blob/d277aae/src/types.d.ts#L1-L35

> TODO: add instructions on overriding the default config
