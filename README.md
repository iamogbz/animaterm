### Script

Samples available in the [end-to-end scripts](./e2e/).

This is a `JSON` file with the following structure:

```ts
Step[]
```

That is a `JSON` array at the root where each `Step` is defined by the following interface:

<https://github.com/iamogbz/animaterm/blob/HEAD/src/types.d.ts#L49-L79>

#### Descriptions

##### clear

##### copy

Copy from start line and position to end line and position as defined in `payload`

##### enter

Return and run commands typed in previous steps

##### paste

> NOTE: does not paste from system clipboard

##### type

##### waitForOutput

### Config

Defined by the interface `Config`:

<https://github.com/iamogbz/animaterm/blob/HEAD/src/types.d.ts#L1-L35>

> TODO: add instructions on overriding the default config
